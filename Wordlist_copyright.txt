This program generates random passwords using 2 random words from a large list of English language words. This creates passwords that are easy to remember but nevertheless very secure.
It currently uses a word list called 2of12inf.txt. 

The word list was created by Alan Beale, who released his work into the public domain. However, his 2of12inf word list is based in part on the AGID list, which was created and copyrighted by Kevin Atkinson <kevina@users.sourceforge.net>.

The AGID list is covered under the following copyrights:
